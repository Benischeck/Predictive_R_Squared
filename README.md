# Predictive_R_Squared
A pythonic solution for calculating predictive r-squared


This function will calculate the value of Predictive R-Squared. It is used as a means of evaluating the R-Squared/Adj-R-Squared value of the training model, by providing evidence suggestive of model under/overfitting. 

I plan to update this with a more bibliographic-style reference guide, as well as the generic formulas I reference in the description of the function. 

I would love any comments/feedback about the function, particularly as they pertain to the accuracy of my interpretation of the formulas used herein.
